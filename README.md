# Integration-TTN-OpenSensors

To make this integration work, there is only two easy steps:
- create a profile on OpenSensors, create a device and the topic in which you wish to publish the informations
- replace with the right values the different elements in the configurations structures (both Opensensors and The Things Network) in the integration.go file.
